## my_lib
# what it is

the idea behind my_lib is to have a 'library' - a collection of functions - that you include in your shellscripts to have
some basic functions, functions like checking if a variable is empty, or is an integer, contains only letters, 
a logging function and so on and so on
instead of writing them always again just include my_lib the usual way (with the source or the dot command) and everything
is in place

# what it is not

complete - no seriously, it is far from being complete, my_lib will be constantly updated which means whenever i come across
something useful i will add it but in case you have any suggestions - please contact me and let me know!

# how do i use it


# what functions are already there and what is their purpose
